# Khet, a school project

## What is this

It's a year long shool project i did in my first year.

It's supposed to be a copy of laser chess.

From what I remmember, it's fully fonctionnal but I might remember wrong.

There is no windows version per say but i don't think there is any reason not to compile on Windows.

It has some weird design choices : they are the results of not enough planning.
